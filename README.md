# Enchantments Permit Acquisition Analysis for Northwest Treks

## Project Overview

Northwest Treks, an adventure outfitting company in Seattle, sought to enhance their chances of obtaining a four-day backpacking permit for The Enchantments in 2024. They seek to secure a 4 day backpacking permit into the Enchantments in 2024 so that they can create a promotional video with their team in this pristine and highly coveted alpine lakes region. The primary objective was to leverage data analytics, specifically through Tableau, to guide their application strategy for the competitive permit lottery.


## Client Application Strategy

My analysis centered around optimizing Northwest Treks' application choices, with a focus on:
- Entry dates
- Zones of The Enchantments to visit
- Group sizes
- Historical weather data

## Data Sources

The analysis utilized two key data sources:
- [2021 and 2022 Lottery Statistics](https://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/okawen/passes-permits/recreation/?cid=fsbdev3_053607)
- [Historical Weather Data](https://prism.oregonstate.edu/explorer/)

## Objectives

The project aimed to address the following key questions:
- What are the historical chances of securing a permit based on lottery data from 2021 and 2022?
- How can the application strategy be optimized to improve the chances of permit approval?
- Given the desire to be in the Core Zone of The Enchantments with average temperatures above 52Â°F and average precipitation below 0.03", what specific dates should be targeted to maximize the probability of permit acceptance?

## Analysis Visualizations

This section contains visualizations created in Tableau to answer key business questions and inform the permit application strategy for Northwest Treks.

### Success Rate by Preferred Zone

*Description*: This visualization compares the success rates for permit applications across different zones within The Enchantments for 2021 and 2022. The analysis underscores the Eightmile/Caroline Zone as having notably higher success rates, especially for group sizes of less than 6.

### Success Rate by Month

*Description*: This comprehensive dashboard correlates historical weather data with permit success rates to identify the best period for entering the Core Enchantment Zone. It suggests early July as an ideal time, considering both the success rates and the historically favorable weather conditions.
