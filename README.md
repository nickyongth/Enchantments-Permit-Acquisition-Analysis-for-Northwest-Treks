## Project Overview

Northwest Treks, an adventure outfitting company in Seattle, sought to enhance their chances of obtaining a four-day backpacking permit for The Enchantments in 2024. They seek to secure a 4 day backpacking permit into the Enchantments in 2024 so that they can create a promotional video with their team in this pristine and highly coveted alpine lakes region. The primary objective was to leverage data analytics, specifically through Tableau, to guide their application strategy for the competitive permit lottery.


## Client Application Strategy

My analysis centered around optimizing Northwest Treks' application choices, with a focus on:
- Entry dates
- Zones of The Enchantments to visit
- Group sizes
- Historical weather data

## Data Sources

The analysis utilized two key data sources:
- [2021 and 2022 Lottery Statistics](https://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/okawen/passes-permits/recreation/?cid=fsbdev3_053607)
- [Historical Weather Data](https://prism.oregonstate.edu/explorer/)

## Objectives

The project aimed to address the following key questions:
- What are the historical chances of securing a permit based on lottery data from 2021 and 2022?
- How can the application strategy be optimized to improve the chances of permit approval?
- Given the desire to be in the Core Zone of The Enchantments with average temperatures above 52°F and average precipitation below 0.03", what specific dates should be targeted to maximize the probability of permit acceptance?

## Analysis Visualizations

This section contains visualizations created in Tableau to answer key business questions and inform the permit application strategy for Northwest Treks.

### Success Rate by Preferred Zone

This visualization compares the success rates for permit applications across different zones within The Enchantments for 2021 and 2022. The analysis underscores the Eightmile/Caroline Zone as having notably higher success rates.

### Success Rate by Month

Highlighting the variability of success rates by month, this chart informs the strategic timing of permit applications. It reveals that May and October are the most favorable months to apply for permits, based on historical data.

### Impact of Maximum Requested Group Size on Success Rate

This graph illustrates the influence of group size on the chances of permit awarding. Smaller group sizes show a higher probability of success, informing recommendations on the optimal group size to apply with.

### Success Rate for Maximum Requested Group Size in the Eightmile/Caroline Zone in October

Diving deeper into the success rates for the Eightmile/Caroline Zone, this visualization pinpoints October as an exceptionally successful month, especially for smaller groups of less than 6, aligning with the recommendations for optimal application strategy.

### Strategic Date Selection for Core Enchantment Zone Permits

This dashboard synthesizes historical weather patterns and permit lottery success rates to recommend the most favorable dates for filming in the Core Enchantment Zone. It points to early July as the prime window for permit applications, where historically, the average temperatures exceed 52°F and precipitation is less than 0.03 inches, aligning with the best chance of securing a permit.
